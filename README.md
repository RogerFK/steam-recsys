# Steam recommender system in pure Python, using Pandas

This repo contains all the required code to the recommendation systems for my Bachelor's Thesis "Building a videogame recommendation system from scratch based on user and game data".

Documentation is kept to a minimum, but I can give some guidance if needed.

The requirements are: `datasketch, numpy, pandas`. Everything else has been done from scratch.

To gather your own dataset, you can find a crawler repository that uses `steamreviews` in [this repo (RogerFK/steam-crawler).](https://github.com/RogerFK/steam-crawler)

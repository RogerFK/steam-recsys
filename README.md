# Steam recommender system in pure Python, using Pandas

This repo contains all the required code to the recommendation systems for my Bachelor's Thesis "Building a videogame recommendation system from scratch based on user and game data".

Documentation is kept to a minimum, but I can give some guidance if needed.

The requirements are: `datasketch, numpy, pandas`. Everything else has been done from scratch.
